# RabbitMQ

This is the core [Apache Brooklyn](http://brooklyn.apache.org/) integration for deployment and in-life management of [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). The details of this catalog item are covered [here](http://brooklyn.apache.org/learnmore/catalog/catalog-item.html#!entities/org.apache.brooklyn.entity.messaging.rabbit.RabbitBroker).

RabbitMQ is an open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The RabbitMQ server is written in the Erlang programming language and is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover. Client libraries to interface with the broker are available for all major programming languages.
